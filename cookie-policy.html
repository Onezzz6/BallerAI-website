        <h1>Cookie Policy for BallerAI</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: April 29, 2025</em></p>

        <p>This Cookie Policy explains how BallerAI ("us", "we", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies when you use our mobile application (the "Service"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>

        <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or use an application. Cookies are widely used by online service providers to make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>

        <h2>2. Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
        <p>We may use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons for our Service to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies may enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Service (e.g., remembering preferences). Third parties may serve cookies through our Service for analytics, performance, and potentially advertising purposes.</p>
        <p>The specific types of first- and third-party cookies potentially served through our Service and the purposes they perform are described below (please note this is a general list and specific usage may vary):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Service and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance and Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Service but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality (like remembering login details or preferences) may become unavailable.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics and Customization Cookies:</strong> These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Service is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Service for you.</li>
            <!-- Add other types if applicable, e.g., Advertising Cookies -->
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How Can You Control Cookies?</h2>
